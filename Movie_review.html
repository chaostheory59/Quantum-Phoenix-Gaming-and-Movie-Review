          <h3>Movie Review</h3>
          <p>In this page we have our reviews for our movies. </p>
		<h4>Valerian</h4>
		<p>Just saw the movie Valerian, its not about the herbal pill that helps you sleep, but the one based on a graphic novel from France, the story revolves around two characters, Valerian and Laureline who are partners who work for the government. The CGI was great and fantastic, much better than avatar.(highly recommend seeing the film in 3-D) Luc Besson is known for his famous movie the "Fifth Element." which included many famous actors like the bad ass Bruce Willis, the beautiful Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman, who is known to play the best villains. 
			His style of futuristic cities in Valerian outdid the cities in the Fifth Element which is why one can say that this film's CGI was a masterpiece. The story was decent but needed more back story. The main characters were not too well developed. Plus it was quite predictable. Now for the characters....The actor who played Valerian was a complete dweeb who acted like a playboy bad ass. The major down side to the movie was the the actor. They should have gotten a better person who can fit the role, not some dweeb who looks like hes still in high school. Plus he was annoying half the time. The actress who played Laureline, despite never playing any other films, did a good job. Not the best but better than the actor who played Valerian. Overall the plot was entertaining, the CGI was amazing but they could have found a better actor to play Valerian. i give it a four thumbs up </p>
